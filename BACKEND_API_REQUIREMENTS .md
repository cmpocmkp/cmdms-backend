## 10. Notes for Backend Development

1. **Permission System**: Implement a robust permission system that checks user permissions for each API call. Permissions should be role-based but can also be user-specific.

2. **Soft Deletes**: Most delete operations should be soft deletes (mark as deleted, don't actually delete from database) to maintain data integrity and audit trails.

3. **Audit Logging**: Log all create, update, and delete operations with user information, timestamps, and change details.

4. **File Storage**: Implement secure file storage with proper access controls. Files should be associated with the entities they belong to.

5. **Notifications**: Implement a notification system that sends notifications when relevant actions occur (replies, status changes, new assignments).

6. **Caching**: Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed data like dropdown lists, statistics, and dashboard data.

7. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure system stability.

8. **Data Validation**: Implement comprehensive data validation on the backend, even if frontend validation exists.

9. **Error Messages**: Provide clear, user-friendly error messages that help users understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

10. **API Versioning**: Consider API versioning for future compatibility and updates.
